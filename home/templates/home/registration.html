<h2 class="lowerer">MBMT Registration</h2>
<p>MBMT is a team-based competition, and students will compete in teams of 5. Teams will compete either in Division A (Pascal) or Division B (Ramanujan). Division A is suggested for students with more practice in competitions, whereas Division B is geared towards students with less experience. There is no limit to the number of teams one school may send.</p>
<p>Coaches unsure of a suitable division for their Mathletes should consult Mr. Jeremy Schwartz at Jeremy_R_Schwartz@mcpsmd.org. However, we will require that Takoma Park, Roberto Clemente, Chesapeake Math Program, and all Homeschoolers compete in Division A.</p>
<p>There should be at least one adult proctor or coach to come with each school or organization. We strongly suggest that the proctor be the sponsor of the schoolâ€™s math team, but if this is not possible a parent or another staff member will be fine.</p>
