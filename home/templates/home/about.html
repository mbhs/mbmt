<h2>Contest Organizers</h2>

<div class="row organizers">
    {% for organizer in organizers %}
    <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6 about-person">

        <h3>{{ organizer.name }}</h3>
        <p>{{ organizer.role }}</p>

<h2>Problem Writers</h2>

<p>We're very thankful to our problem writers, without whom we wouldn't have a contest:</p>

    <li>{{ writer.name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
